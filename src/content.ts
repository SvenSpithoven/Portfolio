    "I'm a communicative enthusiast who values quality and works with precision. Recently I switched from back-end to front-end development because my interest turned out to be more in the visual aspect of an application; the part the user interacts with. Within a period of 2 months I went through an intensive training program internally which enabled me to get started as a React developer. Here I can perfectly express my love for user-friendliness, puzzling and design!",
